We can rotate digits by 180 degrees to form new digits. When 0, 1, 6, 8, 9 are rotated 180 degrees, they become 0, 1, 9, 8, 6 respectively. 
When 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 are rotated 180 degrees, they become invalid.
A confusing number is a number that when rotated 180 degrees becomes a different number with each digit valid.
(Note that the rotated number can be greater than the original number.)
Given a positive integer N, return the number of confusing numbers between 1 and N inclusive.

Input Description:
A integer N as input.(1<N<1000)

Output Description:
Print the number of confusing numbers between 1 and N inclusive

Sample Input:
20

Sample Output:
6

Explanation:
The confusing numbers are [6,9,10,16,18,19].
6 converts to 9.
9 converts to 6.
10 converts to 01 which is just 1.
16 converts to 91.
18 converts to 81.
19 converts to 61.
